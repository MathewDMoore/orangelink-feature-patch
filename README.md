### How do I get it?
1. Update your OrangeLink or OrangeLink Pro to the latest Firmware Here: https://getrileylink.org/product/orangelink#firmware
2. Copy Paste the following script reference into your MacOS "Terminal.app" and press {return} to run the script.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/olpatchfiles)"
```
3. When the script runs it will ask you to choose one of four options..
* Options 1,2,3 will Download a new Workspace and Patch it
* Option 4 will Patch an existing Workspace Build Folder so be sure to be running the script from within that folder.

### What will the script do?
1. Prompt you to choose a Workspace Build
2. Download the selected Workspace to the ~Home\Downloads\BuildX-DATE\ folder
3. Patch the Workspace with the OrangeLink Feature Patch
4. Launch XCode so you can select your Signing Targets and change the Build Scheme to Loop (Workspace).

### Where do I Sign Targets and Which Build Scheme should I use?
1. Click on "Loop" in the Code Navigator on the Left of XCode and you will see the targets to sign with your developer key.
2. You MUST use the "Loop (Workspace)" scheme when building to your phone NOT the "Loop" scheme.  (I have spoken)...
